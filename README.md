Clean-Up-My-Facebook
====================

A small joke project around removing everything from Facebook that is either:

* A sponsored story
* A friend of yours likes a brand
* Any page/company/organization that you've liked posts something

Eventually you'll be able to configure this stuff, but for now the only thing that has
been implemented is removing page stories from the newsfeed. Yeah, I know, that sucks.

Hopefully this will become a chrome extension that anybody can install to make their
Facebook clean from non-friend activity.
